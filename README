What is this ?

This project is about categorizing your junit 4.7> based tests in a good manner. The reason i say 4.7> is that from that time there was added @Rule
which is a brilliant feature to take control of a test without specifying a Runner. A Runner always gives you a certain way run a test and often with 
some additional setup. You don't wanna be forced to do that :-)

Programmer guide to categorize-test :

The easy way to categorize using my Rule is to either make your own subclass and insert this code snippet

@Rule public Categorizable categorizable = new Categorizable();

Or you can extend no.kodemaker.categorize.junit.AbstractCategorizeTest
